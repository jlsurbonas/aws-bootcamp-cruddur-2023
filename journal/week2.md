# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Required Homework

Completed all required homework without any problems. Most of it done while attending live class. I don't really have anything to add here.

### Something else

While doing homework I have noticed that my frontend-react wouldn't start after docker compose up. I went to Docker containers, right clicked on frontend, clicked on View logs. It was showing this error:

I had no idea why or how to fix it. I tried to google my problem, but it wasn't much use. I still couldn't understand what was the problem. So I decided to try and solve it myself. I have restarted GitPod. And this time I noticed:

That gave me an idea that it must be something to do with starting GitPod. But I still wasn't sure where to look. First I looked in frontend-react-js folder and it's content. I couldn't spot any faults. I was looking at all codes I could find. Checked backend-flask folder. Docker-compose.yml. Only then I checked gitpod.yml (not sure why I didn't think to check it first). I couldn't see any mistakes but I was pretty sure now that it's something wrong here. So I compared with Andrew's code. It made me laugh when I spotted my error.

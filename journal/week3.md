# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

## Required Homework

This week's tasks were hard to follow. I made many small mistakes in the code. Something missing out, grammatical mistakes, syntax mistakes, putting code on wrong line or even in wrong file. I had to watch instructions many times, in places much slower to see what's been done. 

Tip for myself. Compare codes. It's easier than just simply watching videos.

I also had a play with changing UI. I found it very intresting to experiment.
